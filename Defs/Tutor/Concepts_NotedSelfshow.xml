        <priority>30</priority>
        <helpText>Your colonists need to have tools either equipped or in their inventory (recommended mod: Pick Up And Haul) in order for them to be able to perform certain tasks effectively.\n\nSelect a colonist, right-click a tool that you want them to use and either have them equip it or put it in their inventory. Colonists can only carry up to 3 tools at once in their inventory, so keep that in mind!</helpText>
