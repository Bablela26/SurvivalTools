Current version: v1.6 (August 2025)

Adds survival tools and the need to manage them to RimWorld.

• Colonists work far less efficiently without the correct tool
• Tools can be carried in inventory or equipped in hand
• Hardcore Mode: pawns cannot perform certain jobs at all without the proper tool
• Automatic tool pickup and swap logic before jobs
• Smarter detection of job–tool requirements (WorkGiver & job fallbacks)
• Acquire tools through crafting, trade, or loot
• Different materials affect durability and effectiveness
• Tools wear down with use and can break
• Configurable mod settings with debugging options
